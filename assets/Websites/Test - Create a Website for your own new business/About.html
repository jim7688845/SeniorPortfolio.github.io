        	<h1>About Us</h1>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know PC Masters, America's   #1 custom computer builder. The internet provides unique opportunities,   but it also allows anyone to appear legitimate and credible. It is   important to know and trust the online companies  you do   business with!</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>PC Masters is based in the Seattle suburb of Auburn, WA, and   specializes in high performance custom built computers. We emphasize   customization over every aspect of each computer, offering personal   consulting and support that is becoming quite rare in the industry. Our   goal is to provide each client with the best possible computer for their   needs and budget.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our vision is simple: Build a high quality product, offer outstanding support and your product will sell itself.  It has become a trend in the last decade for major computer companies to stop focusing on meeting the needs of their customers. Instead, many rely on flashy marketing techniques to make their lower quality systems look more appealing. Be careful when comparing their pricing to PC Masters. Be sure not to fall for computer systems with misleading advertising and substandard parts!</p>
